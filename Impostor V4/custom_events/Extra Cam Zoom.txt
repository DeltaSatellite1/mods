value 1 = cur,add
you can use "cur" to use the current zoom and put a 
value in Add,like this:
cur,0.5
is like: getProperty('defaultCamZoom') + add
value 2 = speed,easing
cur is used to add the currentZoom. Like,if you 
puted 0.1 in the event before and don't disabled
the event, if the cur is true, i'll add.
is like: 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2.
